# openfaas-workshop

[Chinses version](README_zh-tw.md)

This is a self-paced workshop (modifed version of orgin [openfaas-workshop](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop)) for learning how to build, deploy and run serverless functions with OpenFaaS.

The workshop will focus on running OpenFaaS on kubernes and also providing more examples of different languages (including Python, Java & Golang).

![](https://github.com/openfaas/media/raw/master/OpenFaaS_Magnet_3_1_png.png)

In this workshop you begin by deploying OpenFaaS to your laptop or a remote cluster with Docker for Mac or Windows. You will then kick the tires with the OpenFaaS UI, CLI and Function Store. 

After building, deploying an invoking your own Serverless Functions in Python you'll go on to cover topics such as: 

* managing dependencies with pip
* dealing with API tokens through secure secrets
* monitoring functions with Prometheus
* invoking functions asynchronously and chaining functions together to create applications

The labs culminate by having you create your very own GitHub bot which can respond to issues automatically. The same method could be applied by connecting to online event-streams through IFTTT.com - this will enable you to build bots, auto-responders and integrations with social media and IoT devices.

Finally the labs cover more advanced topics and give suggestions for further learning.

## Requirements:

We walk through how to install these requirements in [Lab 1](./lab1.md). Please do [Lab 1](./lab1.md) before you attend an instructor-led workshop.  At the very least you should [install Docker](./lab1.md#docker) and [pre-pull the OpenFaaS images](./lab1.md#Pre-pull-the-system-images).

* Functions will be written in Python(later on Java, Golang might be included), so prior programming or scripting experience is preferred 
* Install the recommended code-editor / IDE [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) / IDE [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* For Windows install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Preferred OS: MacOS, Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, Ubuntu Linux

Docker:

* Docker CE for [Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)/[Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) **Edge edition**
* Docker CE for Linux

> Note: As a last resort if you have an incompatible PC you can run the workshop on https://labs.play-with-docker.com/.

* Apply labels via the GitHub API
* Complete the function

## [Lab 6 - HTML for your functions](./lab6.md)

* Generate and return basic HTML from a function
* Read and return a static HTML file from disk
* Collaborate with other functions

## [Lab 7 - Asynchronous Functions](./lab7.md)

## [Lab 8 - Advanced Feature - Timeouts](./lab8.md)

* Adjust timeouts with `read_timeout`
* Accommodate longer running functions

## [Lab 9 - Advanced Feature - Auto-scaling](./lab9.md)

* See auto-scaling in action
  * Some insights on min and max replicas

  * Observe auto-scaling kicking in


## [Lab 10 - Advanced Feature - Secrets](./lab10.md)

* Adapt issue-bot to use a secret
  * Create a secret
  * Access the secret within the function

## [Lab 11 - Advanced feature - Trust with HMAC](./lab11.md)

* Apply trust to functions using `HMAC`

You can start with the first lab [Lab 1](lab1.md).
